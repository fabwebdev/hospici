# Hospici — Session Controller

> **LOAD ORDER:** (1) Read §Progress to find next task. (2) Load `docs/tasks/tier-N.md` for that task. (3) Read only the `read:` refs listed on that task. **Never pre-load full architecture docs.**
>
> **Context budget:** MEDIUM task = 1 arch doc + task file (~40k tokens max). HIGH task = 2 arch docs + task file. Never combine MEDIUM+MEDIUM in one session.
